# easyinvite
Easyinvite is a simple, intuitive tool to help you make beautiful invite messages in seconds. I created this website as a fun project to improve my web development skills. There are still ways to improve and optimize the website. Thus, it's still under active development.

The client was created using React and Tailwindcss. There is also an integration of the Google maps API for the location input. The server was created using NodeJs, and templates data are stored in the MongoDB database.


Easyinvite is now running on the Render platform:
